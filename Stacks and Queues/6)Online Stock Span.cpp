Online Stock Span
Design an algorithm that collects daily price quotes for some stock and returns the span of that stock's price for the current day.
The span of the stock's price in one day is the maximum number of consecutive days (starting from that day and going backward) for which the stock price was less than or equal to the price of that day.
For example, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,2,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 2, then the span of today is 4 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 2 for 4 consecutive days.
Also, if the prices of the stock in the last four days is [7,34,1,2] and the price of the stock today is 8, then the span of today is 3 because starting from today, the price of the stock was less than or equal 8 for 3 consecutive days.
Implement the StockSpanner class:
StockSpanner() Initializes the object of the class.
int next(int price) Returns the span of the stock's price given that today's price is price.
 
Example 1:
Input
["StockSpanner", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[], [100], [80], [60], [70], [60], [75], [85]]
Output
[null, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
Explanation
StockSpanner stockSpanner = new StockSpanner();
stockSpanner.next(100); // return 1
stockSpanner.next(80);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(70);  // return 2
stockSpanner.next(60);  // return 1
stockSpanner.next(75);  // return 4, because the last 4 prices (including today's price of 75) were less than or equal to today's price.
stockSpanner.next(85);  // return 6

class StockSpanner {
    stack<int> s;
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
public:
    StockSpanner(){
        
    }
    
    int next(int price){
        int cnt=1;
        while(!s.empty()){
            if(s.top() <= price){
                cnt+= m[s.top()];
                s.pop();
            }
            else break;
        }

        m[price]= cnt;
        s.push(price);

        return cnt;
    }
};

The stock span problem is a financial problem where we have a series of daily price quotes for a stock and we need to calculate the span of stock price for all days. The span arr[i] of the stocks price on a given day i is defined as the maximum number of consecutive days just before the given day, for which the price of the stock on the given day is less than or equal to its price on the current day.

Examples:
Input: arr[] = [100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85]
Output: [1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6]
Explanation: Traversing the given input span 100 is greater than equal to 100 and there are no more elements behind it so the span is 1, 80 is greater than equal to 80 and smaller than 100 so the span is 1, 60 is greater than equal to 60 and smaller than 80 so the span is 1, 70 is greater than equal to 60,70 and smaller than 80 so the span is 2 and so on.  Hence the output will be 1 1 1 2 1 4 6.

Input: arr[] = [10, 4, 5, 90, 120, 80]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1]
Explanation: Traversing the given input span 10 is greater than equal to 10 and there are no more elements behind it so the span is 1, 4 is greater than equal to 4 and smaller than 10 so the span is 1, 5 is greater than equal to 4,5 and smaller than 10 so the span is 2,  and so on. Hence the output will be 1 1 2 4 5 1.
 
Input: arr[] = [11, 4, 5, 90, 120, 80]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 4, 5, 1]
Explanation: Traversing the given input span 11 is greater than equal to 11 and there are no more elements behind it so the span is 1, 4 is greater than equal to 4 and smaller than 10 so the span is 1, 5 is greater than equal to 4,5 and smaller than 10 so the span is 2, and so on. Hence the output will be 1 1 2 4 5 1.
