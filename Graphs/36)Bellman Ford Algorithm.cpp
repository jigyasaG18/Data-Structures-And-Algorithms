Bellman Ford Algorithm
Given a weighted and directed graph of v vertices and edges, Find the shortest distance of all the vertex's from the source vertex, src and return a list of integers where the ith integer denotes the distance of the ith node from the source node. If a vertices can't be reach from the s then mark the distance as 10^8.
Note: If the graph contains a negative cycle then return an array consisting of only -1.

Examples:
Input: edges = [[0,1,9]], src = 0
Output: [0, 9]
Explanation: Shortest distance of all nodes from source is printed.

Input: edges = [[0,1,5], [1,0,3], [1,2,-1], [2,0,1]], src = 2
Output: [1, 6, 0]
Explanation: For nodes 2 to 0, we can follow the path: 2-0. This has a distance of 1. For nodes 2 to 1, we cam follow the path: 2-0-1, which has a distance of 1+5 = 6,
