Union of Two Sorted Arrays with Duplicate Elements
Given two sorted arrays a[] and b[], where each array may contain duplicate elements , the task is to return the elements in the union of the two arrays in sorted order.

Union of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements that are present in either of the arrays.
Examples:

Input: a[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], b[] = [1, 2, 3, 6, 7]
Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
Explanation: Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7.

Input: a[] = [2, 2, 3, 4, 5], b[] = [1, 1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 1 2 3 4 5
Explanation: Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2 3 4 5.

Input: a[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1], b[] = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: 1 2
Explanation: Distinct elements including both the arrays are: 1 2.

Constraints:
1  <=  a.size(), b.size()  <=  105
-109  <=  a[i] , b[i]  <=  109

class Solution{
    public:
    //arr1,arr2 : the arrays
    // n, m: size of arrays
    //Function to return a list containing the union of the two arrays. 
    vector<int> findUnion(int arr1[], int arr2[], int n, int m)
    {
        //Your code here
        //return vector with correct order of elements
         int i = 0, j = 0; // pointers
  vector < int > Union; // Uninon vector
  while (i < n && j < m) {
    if (arr1[i] <= arr2[j]) // Case 1 and 2
    {
      if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr1[i])
        Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
      i++;
    } else // case 3
    {
      if (Union.size() == 0 || Union.back() != arr2[j])
        Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
      j++;
    }
  }
  while (i < n) // IF any element left in arr1
  {
    if (Union.back() != arr1[i])
      Union.push_back(arr1[i]);
    i++;
  }
  while (j < m) // If any elements left in arr2
  {
    if (Union.back() != arr2[j])
      Union.push_back(arr2[j]);
    j++;
  }
  return Union;
    }
};
