Mirror Tree
Given a binary tree, convert the binary tree to its Mirror tree.
Mirror of a Binary Tree T is another Binary Tree M(T) with left and right children of all non-leaf nodes interchanged.     

Examples:
Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, N, N, 4]
Output: [1, 3, 2, N, 4]
Explanation: In the inverted tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.

Input: root[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 3, 2, N, N, 5, 4]
Explanation: In the inverted tree, every non-leaf node has its left and right child interchanged.

  public:
    // Function to convert a binary tree into its mirror tree.
    void mirror(Node* node) {
        // code here
    if(node == NULL) return;
    swap(node->left,node->right);
    mirror(node->left);
    mirror(node->right);
    }
