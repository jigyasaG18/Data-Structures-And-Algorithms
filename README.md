## Introduction

Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that enable efficient data storage, organization, and manipulation. This repository serves as a collection of common data structures and algorithms, complete with theoretical explanations and example implementations.

## Directory Structure

The repository is organized into the following folders, each containing specific implementations or examples:

### Arrays
- **Definition**: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Key Operations**: Access, Update, Insert, Delete.
- **Use Cases**: Used for storing a collection of items such as a list of objects, images, etc.

### Linked Lists
- **Definition**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, which are connected through pointers.
- **Types**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists.
- **Use Cases**: Useful for dynamic memory allocation, stack implementation, and maintaining a list of items with frequent insertions/deletions.

### Stacks
- **Definition**: A linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Operations**: Push, Pop, Peek.
- **Use Cases**: Function call management in programming languages, undo features in editors.

### Queues
- **Definition**: A linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Operations**: Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek.
- **Use Cases**: Printer job management, task scheduling.

### Trees
- **Definition**: A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes with a parent-child relationship.
- **Types**: Binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, heap trees, etc.
- **Use Cases**: Hierarchical data representation, search and sort operations.

### Graphs
- **Definition**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- **Types**: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, and Unweighted graphs.
- **Use Cases**: Networks (social, transportation), navigational systems.

### Heaps
- **Definition**: A special tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.
- **Types**: Max-heap, Min-heap.
- **Use Cases**: Priority queues, Heapsort.

### Tries
- **Definition**: A tree-like data structure used to efficiently store a dynamic set of strings.
- **Operations**: Insert, Search, Delete.
- **Use Cases**: Autocomplete features, spell checking.

### Sorting
- **Definition**: The process of arranging the elements of a list in a certain order.
- **Common Algorithms**: Bubble sort, Selection sort, Merge sort, Quick sort.
- **Use Cases**: Data organization, improving the efficiency of search algorithms.

### Searching
- **Definition**: Finding an element in a data structure.
- **Common Algorithms**: Linear search, Binary search.
- **Use Cases**: Locate desired elements quickly.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Definition**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, storing the results of subproblems to avoid redundant work.
- **Use Cases**: Combinatorial problems, optimization problems.

### Greedy Algorithms
- **Definition**: An approach to problem-solving that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.
- **Use Cases**: Minimal spanning trees, Huffman coding.

### Recursion
- **Definition**: A method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem.
- **Use Cases**: Factorial calculation, Fibonacci series generation, tree traversals.
